# To-Do

- [x] Re-read the existing diffs for `docs/decision-framework.md`, `docs/evaluation-criteria.md`, `docs/feature-comparison.md`, and `docs/quick-reference.md` to confirm the earlier review items are resolved.
- [x] Use `git status` and `git diff --name-only docs` to validate which docs remain untouched.
- [ ] Perform full review of untouched docs:
	- [x] `docs/capability-model.md`
	- [x] `docs/glossary.md`
	- [x] `docs/implementation-patterns.md`
	- [x] `docs/resources.md`
	- [x] `docs/scenarios.md`
	- [x] `docs/technologies.md`
	- [x] `docs/visual-framework.md`
- [ ] Capture findings or required edits for each reviewed file.
- [ ] For every section reviewed, ensure changes are concise, maintain narrative flow, and add value only when context supports it.
- [ ] Validate every factual adjustment against the latest Microsoft documentation or official blog posts; when sources conflict, prefer the newest official guidance and expand research scope if needed to confirm intent.
